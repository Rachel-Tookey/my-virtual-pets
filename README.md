## About:

<b>My Virtual Pets</b> is a fun web app that allows users to upload and collect 'virtual pets'.

Virtual Pets are created by users uploading an image, name, description, and personality for their pet. This information is then used to generate a pixel-style image of the pet, as well as assigning the pet a randomly-generated score based on their inputs. A user's complete collection of Virtual Pets can be viewed on the Collection page.

A Virtual Pet's score can be further influenced by other users, who can 'pet' other Virtual Pets. A 'petted' Virtual Pet is added to the user's list of favourite Virtual Pets, and that Virtual Pet's score is increased for each 'pet' it receives.

The app also contains a Leaderboards page, where users can view the top 10 highest-scoring Virtual Pets.

## üê± About:

<b>My Virtual Pets</b> is a fun web app that allows users to upload and collect 'virtual pets'.

Virtual Pets are created by users uploading a photo, name, description, and personality for their pet. This information is then used to generate a pixel-style image of the pet, as well as assigning the pet a randomly-generated score based on their inputs. A user's complete collection of Virtual Pets can be viewed on the Collection page.

A Virtual Pet's score can be further influenced by other users, who can 'pet' other Virtual Pets. A 'petted' Virtual Pet is added to the user's list of favourite Virtual Pets, and that Virtual Pet's score is increased for each 'pet' it receives.

The app also contains a Leaderboards page, where users can view the top 10 highest-scoring Virtual Pets.
